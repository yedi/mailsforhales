As a filthy denizen of the internet, I turned to the web to help understand why people laugh during serious situations. Here's the result of my thorough research

Turns out it's a common problem... at least according to all the memes I found...

I wonder if I make faces like this

Maybe not the _hardest_ thing ever

I def don't want to be like Michael Scott

There are just too many examples!

So I kept looking stuff up and turns out I might have a laughing disorder. At least according to [this article](https://www.verywellhealth.com/laughing-disorder-5094371)

Wondering if I should go see a doctor?

But I could also treat myself. Good thing there's a [wikihow article](https://www.wikihow.com/Stop-Laughing-at-Inappropriate-Times) that teaches how to prevent this from happening. One of the steps is to apologize for the laughter...

I def agree with that one!
