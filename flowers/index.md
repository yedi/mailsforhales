Feria de las Flores is a cool bit of Medellin culture. 

Here are some of the pictures I've been able to capture in celebration

But before that... there's a saying in the hip hop community ["giving flowers"](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Giving%20flowers) that's all about showing appreciation and respect for someone, especially before they're no longer around.

And I wanna do that a lil bit here Hales. Have so much love for you and really hope you know that. Consider this next set of images just a miniscule part of me giving you your flowers.
